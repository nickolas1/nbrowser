      This is a browser-based simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem">gravitational N-body problem</a>, a topic that has fascinated scientists throughout history and the main focus of my <a href="http://nickolas1.com">previous career</a> as an astronomer. In this example you can watch as the stars in a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster">cluster</a> dance around each other as they react to the pull of the other stars' gravity. The 'Kepler planets' option shows four stars, each with three planets orbiting around it.
      </p> 

      <p>
      The stars are advanced in time with a basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration">leapfrog numerical integration</a> scheme written in javascript, and rendered in the browser using <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a>.
      </p>

      The rendering is in the style of either the children's book author <a href="http://www.oliverjeffers.com/picture-books/how-to-catch-a-star">Oliver Jeffers</a> or that of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-mission-announces-a-planet-bonanza/#.VBJfmmRdVcQ">graphics officer for the Kepler space telescope</a>.
